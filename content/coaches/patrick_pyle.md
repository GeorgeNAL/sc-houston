If athletics was as popular as it might one day be, Patrick Pyle would be a household name. Few coaches in the world have approached his achievements in the jumps. 

Since 2010, Pyle has had at least one athlete compete in every United States Track & Field Outdoor Championships, Olympic Games and World Championships. Pyle’s athletes have represented their national teams - United States, Nigeria and Lithuania - in the high jump, decathlon and relays. 

Pyle holds some unique achievements alongside these top-line successes. He became the first American coach to have a male and female high jumper finish the year with a top-10 world ranking. One of those jumpers, Port Arthur-native Inika McPherson, holds the record for highest “height over head”: standing 5’4” tall, McPherson jumped 6’6.75” in 2014, becoming the shortest woman to jump over two meters.

As a volunteer assistant coach at Rice University and the University of Memphis, Pyle led his teams to 14 conference medals, of which 10 were gold. His athletes accumulated all-conference and all-American honors at both programs, and one - high jumper Jordan Wesner - finished 10th at the USA Track & Field Outdoor Championships while a sophomore at Memphis.

A native of Carlsbad, NM, Pyle was an all-conference multi-event athlete at Kansas State University. In addition to working with some of the United States’ top field athletes, Pyle has been a movement coach and strength trainer for athletes of all ages, levels and sports since returning to Houston in 2018.
